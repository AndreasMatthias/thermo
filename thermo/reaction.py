    Only two source of information is available to this function. They are:
        
        * 'Definition', which applies for the elements defined to be zero
        * 'API_TDB', a compilation of heats of formation of unspecified phase.
          Not the original data, but as reproduced in [1]_. Some chemicals with
          duplicated CAS numbers were removed.

    The API data for pentane is incorrect - it is for the gas phase, not the 
    standard liquid state. Likely further data are incorrect.

    The calculated value will be for a "standard-state" value if `dHf` and

    "ideal gas" basis if they are both for an ideal gas. For compounds which
    are gases at STP, the two values are the same.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dHf : float

        [J/mol/K]
    coeffs_elements : list[float]

        target is methane), in the same order as `dHfs_std` and 
        `S0_abs_elements`, [-]
    T_ref : float, optional

    Returns
    -------
    dGf : float
        Gibbs free energy of formation for the created compound, [J/mol]

    Notes
    -----
    Be careful for elements like Bromine - is the tabulated value for Br2 or
    Br?

    Examples
    --------
    Calculate the standard-state Gibbs free energy of formation for water, 
    using water's standard state heat of formation and absolute entropy
    at 298.15 K:

    Calculate the ideal-gas state Gibbs free energy of formation for water, 
    using water's ideal-gas state heat of formation and absolute entropy
    at 298.15 K as a gas:
        
    >>> Gibbs_formation(-241818, 188.825,  [0, 0], [130.571, 205.147], [1, .5])
    -228604.141075
    
    Calculate the Gibbs free energy of formation for CBrF3 (it is a gas at STP,
    so its standard-state and ideal-gas state values are the same) at 298.15 K:

    -622649.329975
    
    Note in the above calculation that the Bromine's `S0` and `Hf` are for Br2;
    and that the value for Bromine as a liquid, which is its standard state,
    is used.
